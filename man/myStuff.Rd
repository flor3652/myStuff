\description{
This is a package that contains some useful functions that were originally created for me and my personal needs.

\details{
As a side note, the \code{keep} function was designed out of several projects I had where I moved quickly between them. I wanted to clear the workspace to avoid naming confusion, but I also wanted several variables to be left alone. \code{keep} can remove all variables from the workspace other than the ones listed
